# AndroidDevelopmentCourse
This repository provides all of developed apps in Ermin Kreponic's Android Development Course on Udemy.
To open the app, download the folder of your desired app, open Android Studio, and find the folder you just downloaded.
Android Studio should recoginize the project. Open the project. You should get a warning message for a missing sdk directory.
Just hit "OK" and the sdk folder should be automatically adjusted. From there, let the app sync, build it and try it out!
